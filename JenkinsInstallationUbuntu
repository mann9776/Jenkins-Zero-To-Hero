First run -> sudo apt update -y
Install java sdk -> 
sudo apt install fontconfig openjdk-21-jre
java -version
Now, install jenkins ->
sudo wget -O /etc/apt/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc]" \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins

If Jenkins fails to start because a port is in use, run systemctl edit jenkins and add the following:
[Service]
Environment="JENKINS_PORT=8081"

Here, "8081" was chosen but you can put another port available.
